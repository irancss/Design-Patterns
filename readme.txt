# Design Patterns in .NET

This document provides an overview and examples of all major design patterns implemented in .NET. Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems and can help improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

## Categories of Design Patterns

1. **Creational Patterns**  
    These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include:
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype

2. **Structural Patterns**  
    These patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects. Examples include:
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

3. **Behavioral Patterns**  
    These patterns focus on communication between objects. Examples include:
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template Method
    - Visitor

## Examples in .NET

Each design pattern can be implemented in .NET using C#. Below are some examples:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows an object to notify other objects about changes in its state.
